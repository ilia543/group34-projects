         <h1> <strong>Vending machine </strong> </h1>
        <p>A vending machine is an automated machine that dispenses items such as snacks, <br>
        beverages, cigarettes, and lottery tickets to consumers after cash, a credit <br>
         card, or other forms of payment are inserted into the machine or otherwise <br>
          made. The first modern vending machines were developed in England in  <br>
           the early 1880s and dispensed postcards. Vending machines exist in many <br>
           countries and, in more recent times, specialized vending machines that  <br>
           provide less common products compared to traditional <br>
        vending machine items have been created.</p>

        <h2> <strong>History </strong>  </h2>
     <p>The earliest known reference to a vending machine is in the work of Hero of Alexandria <br>,
         an engineer, and mathematician in first-century Roman Egypt. His machine accepted a coin <br>
          and then dispensed wine or holy water When the coin was deposited, it fell upon a pan <br> 
          attached to a lever. The lever opened a valve which let some water flow out. The pan  <br>
          continued to tilt with the weight of the coin until it fell off, at which point a   <br>
          counterweight snapped the lever up and turned off the valve. <br>
        Coin-operated machines that dispensed tobacco were being operated as early as 1615 in th <br>
        e taverns of England. The machines were portable and made of brass. An English bookseller, <br>
         Richard Carlile, devised a newspaper dispensing machine for the dissemination of banned  <br>
          works in 1822. Simon Denham was awarded British Patent no. 706 for his stamp dispensing  <br>
          machine in 1867, the first fully automatic vending machine.</p>
        <h4>  <strong>Modern vending machines</strong> </h4>
        <p>The first modern coin-operated vending machines were introduced in London, <br> 
            England in the early 1880s, dispensing postcards. The machine was invented by <br>
             Percival Everitt in 1883 and soon became a widespread feature at railway <br>
              stations and post offices, dispensing envelopes, postcards, and notepaper. <br>
               The Sweetmeat Automatic Delivery Company was founded in 1887 in England <br>
               as the first company to deal primarily with the installation and maintenance <br>
               of vending machines. Also at about that time in England, Dixon Henry Davies <br>
               and inventor John Mensy Tourtel patented a coin-operated reading lamp for <br>
               use on trains and founded the Railway Automatic Electric Light Syndicate, Ltd. <br>
               The system ran off batteries and delivered 30 minutes of light for 1d., but was <br>
               not a long-term success. Tourtel also invented a similarly coin-operated gas meter <br>
               .In 1893, Stollwerck, a German chocolate manufacturer, was selling its chocolate  <br>
               in 15,000 vending machines. It set up separate companies in various territories to  <br>
               manufacture vending machines to sell not just chocolate, but cigarettes, matches, <br>
                chewing gum, and soap products.  <br>
            The first vending machine in the U.S. was built in 1888 by the Thomas Adams Gum Company <br>
            , selling gum on New York City train platforms. The idea of adding games to these <br>
             machines as a further incentive to buy came in 1897 when the Pulver Manufacturing <br>
             Company added small figures, which would move around whenever somebody bought some <br>
              gum from their machines. This idea spawned a whole new type of mechanical device <br>
               known as the "trade stimulators".</p>

        <h2><strong>Mechanisms </strong></h2>
        <p>Internal communication in vending machines is typically based on the MDB standard <br>
            , supported by National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA) and European <br>
            Vending & Coffee Service Association (EVA). <br>

            After payment has been tendered, a product may become available by: <br>
            
            the machine releasing it, so that it falls in an open compartment at the bottom, <br>
             or into a cup, either released first, or put in by the customer, or <br>
            the unlocking of a door, drawer, or turning of a knob. <br>
            
            A vending machine at the Sagamihara Vending Machine Park in Sagamihara, Kanagawa <br>
             Prefecture is restocked with freshly-cooked Udon. <br>
            Some products need to be prepared to become available. For example, tickets are <br>
            printed or magnetized on the spot, and coffee is freshly concocted. One of the <br>
            most common forms of vending machine, the snack machine, often uses a metal coil <br>
            which when ordered rotates to release the product. <br>
            
            The main example of a vending machine giving access to all merchandise after <br>
            paying for one item is a newspaper vending machine (also called vending box) <br>
            found mainly in the U.S. and Canada. It contains a pile of identical newspapers. <br>
            After a sale the door automatically returns to a locked position. A customer could <br>
            open the box and take all of the newspapers or, for the benefit of other customers, <br>
             leave all of the newspapers outside of the box, slowly return the door to an unlatched <br>
             position, or block the door from fully closing, each of which are frequently discouraged, <br>
              sometimes by a security clamp. The success of such machines is predicated on the assumption <br>
              that the customer will be honest, and need only one copy.</p>

        <h2>Common vending machines</h2>
        <h4> <strong>Change machine </strong></h4>
        <p>A change machine is a vending machine that accepts large denominations of currency and returns <br>
             an equal amount of currency<br>
             in smaller bills or coins. Typically these machines are used to provide coins in exchange <br>
              for paper currency, <br>
              in which case they are also often known as bill changers.</p>vending</strong></h4>
        <p>In the past, cigarettes were commonly sold in the United States through these machines, but this <br>
            is increasingly rare due to concerns about underage buyers.<br>
             made. In the United Kingdom, legislation banning them outright came into effect on 1 October 2011.<br>
             In Germany, Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic, and Japan, cigarette machines are still common.<br>
             Since 2007, however, age verification has been mandatory in Germany and Italy <br>
             buyers must be 18 or over. The various machines installed in pubs and cafes, other <br>
             publicly accessible buildings,<br>
              and on the street accept one or more of the following as proof of age: the buyer's <br>
              identity card, bank debit card (smart card)<br>
              , or European Union driver's license. In Japan, age verification has been mandatory <br>
              since 1 July 2008 via the Taspo card,<br>
               issued only to persons aged 20 or over. The Taspo card uses RFID, stores monetary <br>
               value, and is contactless.</p>

        <h4><strong>Birth control and condom vending machines</strong></h4>
        <p>A birth control machine is a vending machine for the sale of birth control,<br>
             such as condoms or emergency contraception. Condom machines are often placed in public toilets, <br>
              subway stations,<br>
              airports, or schools as a public health measure to promote safe sex. <br> Many pharmacies also keep one outside, <br>
               for after-hours access.<br>
             Rare examples exist that dispense female condoms or the morning after pill.</p>
        <h4><strong>Food and snack vending machines</strong></h4>
        <p>Various types of food and snack vending machines exist in the world. Food vending machines that <br>
             provide shelf-stable <br>
             foods such as chips, cookies, cakes, and other such snacks are common.<br>
         Some food vending machines are refrigerated or frozen, such as for chilled soft drinks and ice cream treats,<br>
          and some machines provide hot food. <br>
            Some unique food vending machines exist that are specialized and less common,<br>
         such as the French fry vending machine and hot pizza vending machines, such as Let's Pizza.<br>
         The Beverly Hills Caviar Automated Boutique dispenses frozen caviar and other high-end foods.</p>

        <h4><strong>Bulk candy and gumball vending</strong></h4>
        <p>The profit margins in the bulk candy business can be quite high  gumballs, <br> for instance, can be purchased in bulk for around 2 <br>
            cents per piece and sold for 25 cents in gumball machines in the U.S., and <br>other countries. Gumballs and candy have a relatively <br>
            long shelf life, enabling vending machine operators to manage many machines<br> without too much time or cost involved. <br>
            In addition, the machines are typically inexpensive compared to soft drink or<br> snack machines, which often require power and <br>
            sometimes refrigeration to work. Many operators <br>
            donate a percentage of the profits to charity so that locations will allow them<br> to place the machines for free. <br>
            Bulk vending may be a more practical choice than soft drink/snack vending for<br> an individual who also works a full-time job, <br>
            since the restaurants, retail stores, and other locations suitable for bulk<br> vending may be more likely to be open during the <br>
            evening and on weekends than venues such as offices that host soft drink and<br> snack machines. <br>
            The Bulk vending machines of today provide many different vending choices with<br> the use of adjustable gumball <br>
            and candy wheels. Adjustable gumball wheels allow an operator to not only offer<br> the traditional 1-inch gumball, <br>
            but they can also vend larger gumballs, and non-edible items such as toy capsules<br> and bouncy balls. Adjustable candy <br>
            wheels allow an operator to offer a variety of pressed candies, jelly candy,<br> chocolates and even nuts.</p>
        <h4><strong>Full-line vending</h4>
        <p>A full-line vending company may set up several types of vending <br>
             machines that sell a wide range of products. <br>
             Products may include candy, cookies, chips, fresh fruit, milk, <br>
             cold food, coffee and other hot drinks, bottles and cans of  <br>
             soda and other drinks, and even frozen products like ice cream. <br>
             These products can be sold from machines that include hot <br>
             coffee, snack, cold food, and 20 US fluid ounces (590 ml) bottle machines. In the <br>
             United States, almost all machines <br>
             accept bills with more and more machines accepting $5 bills, along with payment from <br>
             traditional debit and credit cards, <br>
             or a mobile payment system. This is an advantage to the vendor because it virtually <br>
             eliminates the need for a bill changer. <br>
             Larger corporations with cafeterias will often request full line vending to supplement <br>
             their food service.

        <h4><strong>Newspaper vending machine</strong></h4>
        <p>A newspaper vending machine or newspaper rack is a <br>
             vending machine designed to distribute newspapers. <br>
             Newspaper vending machines are used worldwide, and they can be one of the <br>
             main distribution methods for newspaper publishers. According to the <br>
             Newspaper Association of America, in recent times in the United States, <br>
             circulation via newspaper vending machines has dropped significantly: in 1996, <br>
             around 46% of single-sale newspapers were sold in newspaper boxes, and in 2014, <br>
             only 20% of newspapers were sold in the boxes.</p>




        
        <h4><strong>French fry vending machine</strong></h4>
        <p>A French fry vending machine is a vending machine that dispenses hot French fries, <br>
            also known as chips. The first known french fry vending machine was developed circa 1982 by the defunct Precision <br>
            Fry Foods Pty Ltd. in Australia. A few companies have developed and manufactured French fry vending <br>
            machines and prototypes. Furthermore, <br>
            a prototype machine was also developed at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.</p>
        <h4><strong>Pizza vending machine</strong></h4>
        <p>Let's Pizza is the name of a vending machine that makes fresh pizza from scratch.<br>
             It was developed in 2009 by Italian company Sitos srl. <br>
              The machine combines water, flour, tomato sauce, and fresh ingredients to <br>
              make a pizza in approximately three minutes. <br>
               It includes windows so customers can watch the pizza as it is made. <br> 
                The pizza is cooked in an infrared oven. The device was invented by Claudio <br>
                Torghele, an entrepreneur in Rovereto, Italy.<br>
             The vending machine began in Italy and is now spreading into the United Kingdom <br>
             and becoming popular there.</p>
        <h4><strong>Fresh-squeezed orange juice</strong></h4>
        <p>This type of machine contains fresh oranges and a mechanism to cut and squeeze them in order to produce fresh juice.</p>
